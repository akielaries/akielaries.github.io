During my time in undergrad studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Metropolitan       <wbr/>
State University of Denver and then Northern Arizona University, allowed me to be introduced <wbr/>
to a number subjects that caught my interest. Not only topics related to Computer Science and <wbr/>
Mathematics but also Physics, Electrical Engineering, Statistics and the infinite blend of  <wbr/>
these fields. <wbr/>

For anyone interested in diving deeper into some of the topics I have developed interests   <wbr/>
and passion for during my time in undergrad feel free to checkout the section below.        <wbr/>
Attached are some of my personal github repos demonstrating these topics as well as my      <wbr/>
favorite books and additional material that I use frequently.                               <wbr/>

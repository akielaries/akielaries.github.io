I am a current Master's student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying 
Electrical Engineering with an emphasis in Computer Engineering/Embedded Systems
and Power Electronics. I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science from 
Northern Arizona University in December of 2023.

I have interest, experience, coursework, and open-source contributions in various areas
such as low-voltage electronics, embedded & distributed systems, MCUs, circuit design, 
wireless sensor networks, network simulation & containerization, compilers & code generation,
computational mathematics, as well as high performance & scientific computing.

# Some projects...
  * [openGPMP](https://github.com/akielaries/openGPMP) - Open source, general purpose,
  multithreaded capable mathematics package written in C++, C, Fortran, and Assembly
  covering topics such as linear algebra, machine learning, number theory and more to
  serve as a house of optimized mathematical based algorithms.

  * [gpmpBLAS](https://github.com/akielaries/gpmpBLAS) - My own Basic Linear Algebra
  Subprogram (BLAS) reference for openGPMP's Linear Algebra module.

  * [benchmarks](https://github.com/NAU-IoT/benchmarks) - Using C++ and CUDA, benchmarked
  performance of NAU IoT & DiscoverCCRI's NVIDIA Jetson Nanos and Raspberry Pi Compute
  Module IO Boards. Implemented primality test & generation, matrix arithmetic, Fibonacci
  sequence calculations, Monte Carlo methods, and Fast Fourier Transform methods.

  * [i2cscan](https://github.com/akielaries/i2cscan) - A simple I2C utility scanning for
  available I2C busses and addresses similar to i2cdetect from linux's
  [i2c-tools](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/i2c-tools/i2c-tools.git/).
